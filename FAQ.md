## What's News?

#### Q: Where can I find the latest (and greatest) Jekyll news and goodies?

Check the official Jekyll news blog (web: [jekyllrb.com/news](http://jekyllrb.com/news)) 
or the Twitter page (t: [jekyllrb](https://twitter.com/jekyllrb)).

For detailed upcoming major and minor enhancements and bug fixes, see the [History page](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/History.markdown) in the Jekyll repo.

For more Jekyll news see the Vienna.html news page (t: [viennahtml](https://twitter.com/viennahtml)).

For more Jekyll goodies see the [Jekyll bookmark category](http://www.thenewdynamic.org/tool/jekyll/) at the (Static is) The New Dynamic site.


## Themes / Templates

#### Q: Where can I find themes?

Check the [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/) directory or

See the [Themes wiki page](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes) at the Jekyll repo site or

Search Goolge for [jekyll themes](http://google.com/?q=jekyll+themes) 


#### Q: Can I use Bootstrap with Jekyll?

Yes, of course. You can use any HTML starter template/boilerplate with Jekyll.

Jekyll (and GitHub Pages) has built-in support for SCSS, thus, if you use the Bootstrap SCSS version - Jekyll
will auto-build the `bootstrap.css` from the sources letting you change colors,  fonts and much more
in `_settings.scss`.
To get started see the `jekyll-bootstrap-theme` (github: [drjekyllthemes/jekyll-bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/drjekyllthemes/jekyll-bootstrap-theme)) - a ready-to-fork starter theme - as a (live) example.



## Getting Help 


#### Q: Where can I find help?

Use the official Jekyll talk forum (web: [talk.jekyllrb.org](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/)) 
to post your questions and find help on troubleshooting.

Ask your (Jekyll) friends!

For GitHub Pages see the [GitHub Pages Troubleshooting Help Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-troubleshooting/)
for a start. 


#### Q: Where can I find Jekyll friends?

Look for a Jekyll (static site) user group in your city. The first one in Europe 
started in Vienna called [Vienna.html](https://twitter.com/viennahtml).

If there's no Jekyll group yet in your city, why not start one! 
If not, try a local Ruby user group (be aware you might run into some Middleman fanatics ;-),
see the [Awesome Events Page @ Planet Ruby](https://github.com/planetruby/awesome-events) for a world-wide listing.  


## Troubleshooting

#### Q: The Markdown page (e.g. `welcome.md`) gets copied 1:1 to the `_site` folder without getting converted to HTML? Why?

Double check your front matter. Jekyll REQUIRES that your markdown page starts with a front matter section e.g.:

~~~
---
layout: page
title:  "The Front Matters"
---
~~~

Note: The front matter MUST start and end with three dashes e.g. `---` (not two `--` or four `----` etc.). As a rule: Without front matter there's no preprocessing, that is, conversion from Markdown (`.md`) to Markup (`.html`).



## GitHub Pages

#### Q: What Jekyll plugins can I use on GitHub Pages?

See the [GitHub Pages Dependency Versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/) page 
listing all installed (white-listed) Jekyll Plugins.

- `jekyll-mentions` (github: [jekyll/jekyll-mentions](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-mentions)) - @mention support for your Jekyll site
- `jekyll-redirect-from` (github: [jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from)) - seamlessly specify multiple redirection URLs for your pages and posts
- `jekyll-sitemap` (github: [jekyll/jekyll-sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)) - automatically generate a sitemap.xml for your Jekyll site
- `jekyll-feed` (github: [jekyll/jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed)) - a Jekyll plugin to generate an Atom feed of your Jekyll posts
- `jemoji`  (github: [jekyll/jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji)) - GitHub-flavored emoji plugin for Jekyll


## Liquid Templates

#### Q: How can I post (escape) code snippets that include curly brackets `{{ }}`?

Wrap your code snippets with `{% raw %}` tags. Example:

Before:

~~~
{% assign words = content | number_of_words %}
{% if words < 360 %}
   1 min
{% else %}
   {{ words | divided_by:180 }} mins
{% endif %}
~~~

After:  

~~~
{% raw %}
{% assign words = content | number_of_words %}
{% if words < 360 %}
    1 min
{% else %}
   {{ words | divided_by:180 }} mins
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
~~~

Note: Unless escaped (with raw) `{{ }}` and `{% %}` get processed by Jekyll 
as Liquid template tags/directives/macros.



## History / Trivia

#### Q: Why is the Jekyll static site generator called Jekyll (and not Hyde or [your name here])?

Tom Preston-Werner started to put together some Ruby scripts that let you
"[Blog Like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html)" back in 2008
and published the package as Jekyll with 
the tagline "Transform your text into a monster" and a black and white theme. 

The name is inspired by "[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde](http://drjekyllthemes.github.io/jekyll-book-theme/)" - a novella written by 
Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson first published in 1886 in London. 
Why? Read the novella online - generated using the Jekyll world classics book theme ;-) 
Spoiler alert:  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one and only one person.
